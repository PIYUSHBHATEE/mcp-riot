## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jifrozen0110/mcp-riot.git
cd mcp-riot

# Install dependencies (using uv or pip)
uv sync
```


### 2. Get Your API Key and Set Environment

Create `.env` file with your Riot API key:

```ini
RIOT_API_KEY=your_riot_api_key
```
You can get your key from https://developer.riotgames.com/


### 3. Configure MCP Client

Register this server in your MCP client (e.g., Claude for Desktop).

Edit ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json:

``` bash
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "amadeus": {
            "command": "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER",
                "run",
                "--env-file",
                "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/.env",
                "riot.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

> Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/` with the actual path to your project folder.

my case:

``` bash
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "amadeus": {
            "command": "/Users/jifrozen/.local/bin/uv",
